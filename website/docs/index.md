# Getting Started

## Installation

For testing with Docker, follow the instructions on the [testing README](https://github.com/knightss27/grafana-network-weathermap/tree/main/testing#readme). This will provide you with an instance to play around with.

To install unsigned to your own Grafana instance, download the [latest release zip](https://github.com/knightss27/grafana-network-weathermap/releases/latest/). This page will be updated once this plugin is officially on the Grafana plugin store (which you will be able to install from there or using their cli).

## Creating a New Weathermap

1. In Grafana, create a new `Empty Panel`.
2. Change the visualisation in the top right corner to `Network Weathermap`.
3. You now have a brand new network weathermap panel! ðŸŽ‰
4. Learn about weathermap [basics](basics.md).
