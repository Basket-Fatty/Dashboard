# Grafana Network Weathermap Plugin

This plugin brings customizeable and modern looking network weathermaps to Grafana. The design remains similar to the well known [PHP Network Weathermap](https://www.network-weathermap.com/), well allowing for interoperability with Grafana, and easy customization.

[Link to the wiki! (WIP)](https://grafana-weathermap.seth.cx/) or [download the latest version.](https://github.com/knightss27/grafana-network-weathermap/releases/latest/)

The plugin was also recently signed for Grafana! This means you can install the current version (as I have last uploaded to Grafana) from [their website](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/knightss27-weathermap-panel/) directly.

**If you would like to simply test the plugin to play around in a separate environment, please clone this repo and then follow the directions in the [testing README](https://github.com/knightss27/grafana-network-weathermap/tree/main/testing#readme).** Or if you know how, you can probably do something similar in your own Grafana environment by just installing the plugin through their site / cli.
