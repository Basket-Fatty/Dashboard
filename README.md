# WIP! Grafana Network Weathermap Plugin

This plugin is meant to allow Grafana to create easily accessible network weathermaps, incorporating the data one might already have inside Grafana.

It is currently a work in progress, much basic visual layout is close to being completed, with nodes/links/etc., however the next major focusing is allowing the incorporation of data from Grafana (which is obviously signficant for a Grafana plugin).
